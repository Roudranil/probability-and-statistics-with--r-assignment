# Probability and Statistics with R assignment

This is our group assignment for the first semester in Probability and Statistics with R at Chennai Mathematical Institute (C.M.I),Chennai.

The assignment was completed by the following students:  
- Roudranil Das [Roll: `MDS202227`]
- Saikat Bera [Roll: `MDS202228`]
- Shreyan Chakraborty [Roll: `MDS202237`]

The complete code of the solutions to the problems is available [here](https://github.com/Roudranil/probability-and-statistics-with-r-assignment/blob/main/code/assignment-2-code.Rmd). The corresponding pdf is available [here](https://github.com/Roudranil/probability-and-statistics-with-r-assignment/blob/main/report/assignment-2-code.pdf).

The folders [rough-work-roudranil](https://github.com/Roudranil/probability-and-statistics-with-r-assignment/tree/main/rough-work-roudranil), [rough-work-saikat](https://github.com/Roudranil/probability-and-statistics-with-r-assignment/tree/main/rough-work-saikat), [rough-work-shreyan](https://github.com/Roudranil/probability-and-statistics-with-r-assignment/tree/main/rough-work-shreyan) contains all the individual work done by the 3 collaborators.

- Problem 1 was solved by Saikat Bera and Shreyan Chakraborty
- Problem 2 and 3 were solved by Roudranil Das
- Problem 4 was solved by Saikat Bera
- Problem 5 was solved by Shreyan Chakraborty

Summary of Problem 1:  
- We had to fit a probabilistic model for the number of goals scored by the home team in Premier League.
- From given sample statistis we had to estimate parameters and abide by desired assumptions.
- Comparison between Geometric and Poisson Distribution model was done.

Summary of Problem 5:  
- We had to fit a linear model for the return of TCS with that of the return of NIFTY
- We had to estimate the coefficients of the linear model using Method Of Moments
- We again estimated the coefficients using lm() function and then compare it with that of Method Of Moments.
- Then prediction was mad for a new data using the fitted model.
